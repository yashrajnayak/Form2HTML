## How to Use

### Method 1: Using a Google Form Prefill URL

1. **Get a Google Form Prefill URL**:
   - Create a Google Form
   - Click the three dots menu (‚ãÆ) in the top right
   - Select "Get pre-filled link"
   - Fill in some example values
   - Click "Get Link"
   - Copy the generated URL

2. **Convert the Form**:
   - Paste the prefill URL into the converter
   - Optionally customize the form title and theme color
   - Click "Convert Form"

### Method 2: Using the HTML Source (Recommended for better field labels)

1. **Get the HTML Source of your Google Form**:
   - Open your Google Form in the browser
   - Right-click anywhere on the page and select "View Page Source"

2. **Convert the Form**:
   - Switch to the "HTML Source" tab in the converter
   - Paste the copied HTML into the text area
   - Optionally customize the form title and theme color
   - Click "Convert Form"

   - Preview the form to ensure it looks correct
   - Copy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code
   - Integrate the code into your website

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Input Processing**: The tool can process either a Google Form prefill URL or the complete HTML source of a form
2. **Data Extraction**: 
   - From URL: Extracts form field IDs and values
   - From HTML: Extracts field IDs, values, and question labels
3. **Field Type Detection**: Automatically detects appropriate input types (text, email, number, etc.)
4. **Code Generation**: Creates clean, semantic HTML with matching CSS and JavaScript
5. **Form Submission**: The generated form submits data directly to Google Forms

### Files Structure

- `index.html` - Main application HTML
- `css/styles.css` - Application styles
- `js/parser.js` - Google Form URL parser
- `js/generator.js` - HTML/CSS/JS code generator
- `js/app.js` - Main application logic

## Limitations

- Only supports basic field types (text, email, number, date, URL)
- Does not support complex Google Form features like:
  - File uploads
  - Grid questions
  - Multiple choice questions (these would need custom handling)
  - Conditional logic
- Form validation is basic (required fields only)

## Privacy & Security

- All processing happens in your browser - no data is sent to any server
- Your form URLs and data never leave your computer
- The generated forms submit directly to Google's servers, just like the original form

## Development
